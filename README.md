# Iot-based-gas-leakage-detection-system
Arduino code for IOT based Gas Leakage detection system 
Use this code to run in an Arduino board along with the following components
Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno or Arduino Nano)
      MQ6 Gas Sensor Module
      Buzzer
      WiFi Module (e.g., ESP8266 or ESP32)
      Jumper Wires (male-to-male and male-to-female)
      Breadboard (optional, for prototyping)
      Power Source (USB cable or external power supply)
      Resistors and Capacitors (if needed for sensor calibration or noise filtering)
      Enclosure (optional, for housing the components in a protective case)

Procedure:
Hardware Connections:

Connect the VCC pin of the MQ6 sensor module to the 5V pin on the Arduino board, and the GND pin to the GND pin on the board.
Connect the AOUT pin of the MQ6 sensor module to an analog input pin (e.g., A0) on the Arduino. 
Connect the buzzer's positive (Anode) pin to a digital output pin (e.g., pin 8) on the Arduino, and the negative (Cathode) pin to the GND pin.

WiFi Module Integration:

Interface the WiFi module with the Arduino using serial communication (TX and RX pins). 
Make sure to power the WiFi module using the 3.3V pin on the Arduino or an external power source (check the module's power requirements).

Code Upload:

Write an Arduino sketch that reads the analog output from the MQ6 sensor and converts it to gas concentration levels.
Based on the concentration levels, trigger the buzzer to emit an audible alarm. 
Implement WiFi communication to send the gas concentration data to a remote server or cloud for monitoring.

Calibration (Optional):

If required, calibrate the MQ6 sensor module based on the gas being detected. 
This step ensures accurate gas concentration readings.

Power On:

Power on the Arduino board, and the gas detection system will start detecting gas concentrations in the environment.

Remote Monitoring (Optional):

Access the data sent by the Arduino via the WiFi module on a remote server or cloud platform to monitor the gas concentration levels in real-time.
